all file downloaded for installation are remove (if it's possible).

### main alias (in bashrc-min)

I put some alias what are very usefull :
- phpStorm
- intelliJ

### less usefull alias (in bashrc-full)

Those alias are more useless if you don't use some software :
- emptyHtdoc (what rm all file contains in /opt/lamp/htdoc). Useless if you don't use an apache server.
